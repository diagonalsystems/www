integrating security into agile development methods


Developers are shifting to a DevOps delivery model to increase the speed of delivering new code and features to the market.

security policies vs developer velocity


- User Stories vs. Attacker Stories

- Secure and manage secrets used by machines (e.g. micro-services, applications, scripts, CI/CD tools, hosts, etc.) and privileged users throughout the DevOps pipeline.

- Integrate with DevOps Toolchain to secure and manage secrets used by CI/CD tools such as Jenkins, Docker, Puppet, Chef, etc. to balance speed and automation while still significantly reducing the threat surface.

- Help security and compliance professionals to automatically secure and manage secrets throughout the DevOps pipeline by implementing built-in privileged account best practices across all environments (cloud, on-premises and hybrid environments).



startups:

> This resource-constrained environment demands that leaders must do more with less, and often increases the risk of failure to achieve the desired end state. Because the strategic environment is rapidly changing, decision makers must learn to think smarter and more creatively in order to get the most out of dwindling resources. Creative solutions are not achieved without taking risk, and often deviate sharply from known ways of doing things.

- do more with less (get the most out of dwindling resources)
- think smarter and more creatively
