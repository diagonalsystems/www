- Running your own Elasticsearch cluster on AWS EC2 will be much cheaper (about 2 times as much) and will give you full control, visibility and accessibility if you set it up right. Deployment is really easy if done using Terraform (see my Elasticsearch Cloud Deploy repository), and then sizing and monitoring is as easy as with using a cloud offering.
