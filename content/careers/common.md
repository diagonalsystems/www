All work is remote. We use an asynchronous collaboration method, which means you choose your own hours. You don’t have to be online at any given time. You can take random days; you can have a 6 hours break in the middle of your workday; you can change your schedule every week. Take time off, too. The most critical thing is that you get a lot of stuff done.

Crunch time is not a thing with Diagonal. Since starting the company in 2018, we’ve never once asked a collaborator to work more than 40 hours a week. To make this work, you must have the ability to be seriously productive without having to be pushed.

Pay is determined based on your capabilities, our needs, and market conditions.
