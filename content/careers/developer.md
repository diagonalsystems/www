This is primarily a programming position. You’ll be writing code from fresh designs, updating older code, optimizing, fixing and organizing bugs, testing, and so on. Since our company is so small, you’ll be touching many systems – database, servers, frontend, and everything else.

Depending on your interest and ability, you may be involved in software design work as well. This can range from filling in details of a new system, to writing candidate designs for solving a design problem, to broader evaluations of design direction and comparisons with other software.

Overall hours should equal that of a typical 40-hour-per-week job, but you can distribute those across the week however you like.

Programming-focused collaborators tend to gravitate towards technical tasks, which means the day-to-day work usually revolves around implementing written designs and task lists. However, given the demonstrated desire and ability to take on broader tasks, we are definitely open to offering higher levels of independence down the line.

## Requirements

- Be able to do useful programming from day one. The core of work in this position is writing code according to assignments. This means that, at minimum, you’ll need to be have practical experience in working on large codebases and complex problems in a C-like language. Typescript experience is ideal since that’s what we use for most of our code.
- Have programming projects of significant scope to show off. These could be mods, indie games, game engines, professional games you worked on, or something else. These can’t be typical school projects or something you threw together with pals in a couple weeks or months. As a general minimum, a “significant project” is one that you worked on most days for at least a six months.
- Be productive. You should be able to get a lot of stuff done in a given span of time. Even if your work quality is good, the pace of it is also important.
- In your application, if possible please include links to where we can read some code you’re written. 

## Advantages

- Experience in software design. This is valuable, but not absolutely necessary. Note that simply writing ideas or analyses does not count as software design experience. Implementing ideas and seeing them play out yourself is minor experience. Real experience is having other people with no relationship to you use your software and then responding to their feedback with improvements.
- Cross-disciplinary skills. Ability in art, audio, music, web design, publicity, and marketing are valuable, but not absolutely necessary.

## Good to have

- Creative output. We want to see things you’ve created – games, design articles, books, paintings, animations, music, or anything else. Even things going back to childhood. Long-standing creative passion is valuable and shows that you can actually do things instead of just having “interests”. It’s not enough to have passion for the idea of writing software; you need to have passion for the work.
- Curious mind. You’ve read books beyond the top sellers and can talk about the ideas in them. You know some history beyond high school and have coherent opinions on them. Have interests in random subjects. Have sources of ideas which give you unique reference points to draw from.
