      p Diagonal is a boutique computer security company.

      p 
        | Our mission is to protect our communityâ€™s technological businesses
        | from adversaries who wish to do them harm.

      p 
        | We do this by studying and then replicating adversary behaviour to challenge our clients' security posture. We then help them design, implement and deploy security software and policies.

      h2.fw3.f3 Areas of Focus

      p We specialize in researching, attacking and defending modern applications:

      ul
        li Service Oriented Architectures
        li Virtualized Environments
        li Container-based workflows
        li Serverless Runtimes

      p We usually work with startups and small to medium organizations, who face similar challenges securing their systems as their much larger counterparts, but must do so with less expertise and fewer resources.
